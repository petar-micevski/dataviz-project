# How to think like a Grandmaster
This is my first attempt of using Ggplot and Dplyr to extract information using EDA from one of my favorite hobbies: Chess.
Below are some of the summaries of my project. For a more in depth look, please look into the R Markdown File attached to this repository.

* Im not going to be any type of master anytime soon as a chess rank of 1300 implies that I am the bottom 25th percentile, or as I like to call it, the top 75th percentile

* Whenever I start a game, I should make it an official game so I can be more accurately paired with someone closer to my rank. If I play an unrated game, I can loosen up.

* In order to improve my rank, I need to study more opening lines and understand the strategic reasoning behind my moves. Eventually, strategic intuition and following chess principles outweighs book moves

* To avoid uneccesary flaggings, I should include an increment to my time so I could focus on the game at hand, not the ticking clock

* If I see a player ranked 350 points less than me, I can relax because I have an 85% chance of having the game in the bag. If I see a player ranked 1000 points less than me, I can win the game blindfolded no question

* Playing actively doesn't necessarily mean playing well. Most players that play start and finish around the same rank as before
